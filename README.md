# Course 4: Applied Predictive Modeling

Statistical Learning is a field that ties together statistical theory and practice
with the methods of machine learning that have emerged in the last several decades.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this course students will be able to 

- Describe the framework of statistical learning (i.e. supervised vs. unsupervised learning) and map a data analytical question to a location in this framework.
- Outline the different capabilities of statistical learning models  (predictive, inferential, descriptive/explorative) and be able to discern which is needed in a particular scenario.
- Discuss the bias-variance tradeoff in supervised learning and apply the concept in making decisions about model selection.
- Apply tools of cross validation and regularization to guard against overfitting a model.
- Construct a supervised learning model drawn from the following list of methods. For each method, they will be able to link the research question to appropriate methods, understand the principles at work in each method, implement the method in R, and interpret the output and how it bears on the research question.
    - Supervised Learning:
        - Linear regression
        - Penalized regression (ridge, lasso)
        - CART
        - Random Forests
        - Boosted Trees
    - Classifiation:
        - Logistic regression
        - Discriminant analysis
        - k-Nearest Neighbor
        - CART
        - Random Forests
- Apply multiple regression techniques to a real data set and evaluate/synthesize the results is a sytematic manner.
- Apply multiple classification techniques to a real data set and evaluate/synthesize the results in a systematic manner.
- Recognize when a data set might benefit from a dimension reduction technique, implement that technique, and interpret the output.
- Implement clustering techniques (k-means, hierarchical clustering), describe the similarities and differences in their approach, and use a scree plot to discern the scale of clustering.
