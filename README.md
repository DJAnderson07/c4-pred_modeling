# Course 4: Applied Predictive Modeling
This repository will house all the materials for the fourth course in the data science specialization using R, developed for the UO COE.

## Learning objectives
* Understand differences between predictive and inferential statistics, and when predictive modeling methods are preferable
* Understand the bias-variance trade-off (over- versus under-fitting the data) and various approaches to assessing model fit.
* Be able to evaluate model tuning parameters using cross-validation procedures (e.g., *k*-fold).
* Understand and be able to apply basic tree-based models

### Andrew - this is just an initial pass, I'm totally open to any of this changing
