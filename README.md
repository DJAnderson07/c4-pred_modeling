# Course 4: Applied Predictive Modeling

Statistical Learning is a field that ties together statistical theory and practice
with the methods of machine learning that have emerged in the last several decades.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this course students will be able to 

- Describe the framework of statistical learning (i.e. supervised vs. unsupervised learning) and map a data analytical question to a location in this framework.
- Outline the different capabilities of statistical learning models  (predictive, inferential, descriptive/explorative) and be able to discern which is needed in a particular scenario.

- bias-variance
- cross-validation/regularization
- regression methods (for all supervised: link to problem, principles at work, implementation, interpretation and use)
- classification methods
- dimension reduction methods
- clustering methods

- Apply a multiple regression techniques to a real data set and evaluate/synthesize the results is a sytematic manner.
- Apply a multiple classification techniques to a real data set and evaluate/synthesize the results in a systematic manner.
